Cyber Defense Intelligence Toolkit includes 3 independent tools:
SCWLA: Security Control Weakness Logic Analyzer
EAPADA: Ethical AI Payload Awareness & Defensive Analyzer
VWPA: Vulnerability Weaponization Projection Analyzer

For SCWLA,
To identify what defensive security controls exist and what are original weakness of themselves

Steps:
Parses recon data of website

Uses rule-based detection (e.g., WAF, TLS, authentication indicators)

Extracts line-level evidence

Use LLaMA for weakness analysis and contextual defensive analysis

Optionally enriches reasoning with corpus/corpora knowledge



For EAPADA,
To detects which vulns exist and which vulns cause possible attack behavior signals and malicious intent patterns.

Steps:
Detects payload classes (Injection, Auth abuse, Logic flaws, DoS indicators) based on vulns

Maps findings to MITRE ATT&CK and OWASP categories

Applies lightweight risk scoring

Use LLaMA for contextual defensive analysis

Optionally enriches reasoning with corpus/corpora knowledge


For VWPA,
To analyzes which vulns exist and why vulnerabilities are attractive to attackers and how they could be strategically weaponized.

Steps:
Detects vulnerability conditions

Evaluates attacker value and chaining potential

Uses LLaMA to analyze strategic weaponization and to provide defensive analysis

Optionally enriches reasoning with corpus/corpora knowledge


Include 3 options:
Option 1 (No internal corpus or dynamic corpus/corpora zip)

LLaMA reasons using only its pretrained knowledge

It analyzes detected signals and generates defensive insights

Works like an expert answering from experience


Option 2 (Internal Corpus, corpus_scwla for SCWLA tool, corpus_eapada for EAPADA tool, corpus_vwpa for VWPA tool)

Internal corpus is appended to the prompt

LLaMA uses it as supporting knowledge

It may expand or refine beyond corpus content


Option 3 (Dynamically Uploaded Corpus/Corpora zip)

Uploaded documents are appended

LLaMA enriches reasoning using that documentation

Still performs independent reasoning


***Internal Corpus, dynamically uploaded corpus/corpora zip are used as optional because 
LLaMA is a pretrained NLP model trained on massive internet-scale text data.

So, it already understands Cybersecurity concepts, vulns, attack patterns, defensive practices, risk reasoning and more for Cybersecurity industry.
This toolkit is cyber defensive intelligence toolkit for 2 dimensions(security team dimension, attacker dimension). 
2 dimensions because first, 
if security teams, they can prepare to prevent based on vulns before big attack and 
next, if attacker, if knows which vulns can be recovered with which preventions so attacker can go to another leak or ways by avoiding preventions. 



For SCWLA, if security team, if which security controls existed in website and which weakness of themselves are known, security team can do preventions for them.
If attacker, can attack via weakness of these controls and go to another by avoiding these preventions.

For EAPADA, if security team, if which vulns can cause which attack payloads, security team can prevent on vulns.
If attacker, can attack based on preventions for which vulns and go to another leak by avoiding these preventions.

For VWPA, if security team, if which vulns can cause which all possible attack weaponizations, security team can prevent.
If attacker, can attack based on preventions for which vulns and go to another leak by avoiding these preventions.

So, LLaMA's indenpendently reasoning/enriching on optional corpus/corpora knowledge is enough for intention of this toolkit as reasoning engine.


***LLaMA as NLP,
Toolkit firstly detects vulnerabilities, payload classes, or control gaps using rule-based logic.

Optionally, it merges corpus knowledge (internal, uploaded, or multi-corpora) into a single prompt.

LLaMA receives a text prompt combining-

Detected signals (findings)

Vulnerability or payload class names

Optional corpus knowledge
